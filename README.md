- 👋 Hi, I’m @mpnetwork1 and I'm new to github. 
- 👀 I’m interested in furthering my credentials and technical knowledge with consistant practice. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to play the harmonica, garden and further my coding knowledge. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with several artists, entrepreneurs, visionaries, directors and tech savy creative individuals because it will be extremely rewarding to me. 
- 📫 How to reach me? Please don't reach me, as I'm honestly a still a "rookie" learning. If I want to be reached, I will make it known, when I feel confident. Until then, this is a long term learning experience for me. Thank you.
